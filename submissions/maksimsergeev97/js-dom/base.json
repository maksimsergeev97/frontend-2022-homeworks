With most residences destroyed, what's left is highly valued by owners and real estate agents. It seems most housing communites now are fenced communites, with only way of getting in is to bring them a 'severed head of one of the co-op board's many dangerous enemies', according to a recently published article 'You WISH You Lived in These AMAZING Luxury Homes' from Blurtfeed."
